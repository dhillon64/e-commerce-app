# e-commerce-app
A full-stack E-commerce app, which involved creating the frontend and backend. I have created the server with node.js and have added mongoDB for storing data. 
The frontend has been created with React and I have added Redux for state management. Styling has been added with react-bootstrap. It has full add to cart features ,
payment processing via paypal API and authentication functionality, so users can log in, make purchases and view orders.
